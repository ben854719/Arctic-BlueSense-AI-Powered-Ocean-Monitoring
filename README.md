## Arctic BlueSense: AI Powered Ocean Monitoring

## Objective:

This application is an AI powered monitoring system for the Canadian Arctic Ocean, built for defense, environmental protection, and scientific research. It uses Polars and Pandas for high performance data cleaning and transformation, achieving sub second preprocessing on large sensor and vessel tracking datasets. A machine learning anomaly detection model identifies unusual vessel activity, intrusions, or climate driven water changes, targeting >95% detection accuracy and water changes. All sensitive datasets are secured using RS256 encryption, ensuring integrity and controlled access with 100% audit trace coverage. An agentic AI assistant provides real time alerts, explanations, and decision support, maintaining during peak data ingestion. The application is designed for startups, government agencies, and researchers who need to collect and analyze information about the Canadian Arctic Ocean.
